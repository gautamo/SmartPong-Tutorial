# Terms and Concepts
Here are the technical terms you should know to understand the SmartPong program!

### Machine Learning
Machine learning is divided into three categories. Supervised learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. In the supervised learning algorithm, we feed the data as the input to our model as well as the expected output, then we let our model come up with the fastest and the most efficient algorithm to get the desired output. In the unsupervised learning algorithm, we feed the data to our model as the input and let the algorithm to find a relationship between data and categorizes them. 

In reinforcement learning, we feed the data to our model as the input and compare the accuracy through objective function then we change the model‚Äôs parameters and repeat the operation. In other words, in reinforcement learning, we have an agent which learns how to behave in an environment by performing actions from the results. For instance, in the smartPong program, we get a snapshot of the game pong and give this data as the input to our model, our model decides whether to go up or down and finally we check whether our model has won the game to get a reward of +1 or lost the game to give a -1 reward through objective  function and based on those rewards, our model modifies its behavior through optimization algorithm. 

### Neural Networks
Neural networks contain algorithms that are modeled after the human brain in order to recognize patterns. They classify ungrouped data by finding similarities to the sample set of data. Humans group examples of data in order to be used as the ‚Äúfoundation‚Äù for the neural network to find patterns. Any labels that humans can identify can be used to train neural networks. Although classification requires labels, deep learning does not. 
Deep learning can also be considered as unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning models have more chances of being accurately trained because these often train on large sets of data which help increase precision.
The networks are composed of nodes that are in each layer. Nodes assign numerical significance to input data. They also combine the input with coefficients, also known as weights. These products are then summed and passed through an activation function that determines whether or not the product will progress further. 
 
In deep neural networks, each layer of nodes trains a certain set of features based on the previous layer. This results in precision. The deeper into the neural net that you go, the more advanced elements you will see because each layer is building off the previous. When training, nodes try to reconstruct the input from samples over repetitions in order to minimize error. Neural networks find similarities and what the represent, whether it is based on labeled data or is a complete reconstruction. 
When starting to train, neural networks will create models based on a collection of weights (coefficients). This tries to model data's relationship to labels in order to grasp the data's structure. When learning, the Input is out into the network and the weights connect that input with a set of guesses. The network then takes the guess and compares it to its true classification to assume error. The weights are then adjusted to decrease error.
```python
input * weight = guess | ground_truth - guess = error | error * weight's contribution to error = adjustment
```
These are the three key functions of neural networks: scoring input, calculating error, and updating the model. A neural network also uses linear regression. 
```python
y = bx + a
```
With many input variables, the formula looks like this:
```python
y = b1 * x1 + b2 * x2 + b3 * x3 + a
```
This multiple linear regression will happen at every node of the neural network. The inputs are combined with different coefficients in different proportions.

### Policy Network
 The network that transforms input frames to output actions. The simplest method to train a policy network is with a policy gradient.

### Policy Gradient (Descent)

Gradient Descent is also known as the optimization function. Gradient is also known as "slope" and represents the relationship between the 2 variables. Because the neural network is trained to test out different weights, the relation between the error and the weights is the derivative dE/dw. This measures the slightest degree change that affects error. These are passed through an activation function, sees if there is a change in error, and checks how weights affect activation. This formula sums up the relationships.
```python
dError/dWeight=  dError/dActivation  *dActivation/dWeight
```
There are numerous parameters that keep updating in order to reach peak optimization. Gradient descent is typically used when parameters cannot be calculated analytically, with algebra, but rather when an algorithm is necessary. The coefficients are exchanged in order to find the lowest and best cost. The initial values will start at 0.0 or some random small value. The derivative is calculated in order to find the rate of change of the function. Executing the derivative makes it easier to find the coefficient values by helping limit the domain. Next, Œ± is used to define the learning rate. This specifies how much the coefficients can change on each update. If the change is too drastic, accuracy may be lost.
```python
J(coefficient) = cost  | Œî =  d/dw cost | coefficient = coefficient - (Œ±Œî)
``` 
These steps are repeated until the cost gets as close to 0 as possible. It is recommended to plot cost vs time. By plotting the cost values per iteration, you will be able to clearly see if the gradient descent run is decreasing. If it is not decreasing, the learning rate should be reduced. 

### Rewards
The Reward Hypothesis is considered the ‚Äúmaximization of the expected value of the cumulative sum of a received scalar signal‚Äù. The objective is to maximize this set of rewards. In order to do this, one must look into the Markov Decision Process (MDP). 

In simple terms, the MDP states the probability of transitioning into a different state while getting some reward depending on the current state. In other words, any action in the future is only dependent on the present, not the past. Adding these rewards of different levels of significance with rewards from the future result in discounted returns. A higher discount factor leads to higher sensitivity for rewards.

### Sparse and Dense Rewards
For sparse rewards instead of receiving a reward at the end of every step/action, we receive a reward for the end of an episode. The agent learns what part of the episode action sequence led to the reward in order to imitate that sequence in the future. Sparse rewards are sample inefficient meaning the reinforcement learning program needs lots of training time before executing useful behavior. 
For a dense reward system rewards are given at the end of every step of an episode. The program is influenced by immediate rewards rather than working towards a long term goal implying a shallow lookahead. SmartPong will be using a sparse reward system.

### Discount Factor
Determines the importance of the accumulated future events in the MDP model. A higher Œ≥ leads to a higher sensitivity for rewards in future steps. To prioritize rewards in the distant future, keep gamma closer to one. A number closer to one will consider the previous results; however a number closer to zero will not learn anything. A discount factor closer to zero indicates that only rewards in the immediate future are being considered, implying a shallow lookahead. A factor equal to or greater than 1 will cause the convergence of the algorithm. However high enough discount factors (ie. Œ≥ = 0.99) result in similar intertemporal preferences with the same behavior as having a discount factor of 1. The optimal discount factor largely depends on whether a sparse reward (Œ≥ = 0.99 most optimal) or dense reward (Œ≥ = 0.8 may perform better) system is in place. If one wants to weigh earlier experience less they may try a myopic function where gamma grows linearly from 0.1 to a final gamma (ie. Œ≥ = 0.99 or 0.8) as a function of the total timesteps.

### Q-Learning

Q-Learning is considered an off-policy algorithm because it learns from actions that occur outside the current policy. Its goal is to learn a policy that maximizes reward. The Q stands for quality which represents the usefulness of a certain action in gaining a reward.

First, you must create a matrix containing [state, action] called a q-table. The values must be initialized to 0. After each episode, these values will be updated. The agent can either Explore or Exploit. Exploiting includes using the q-table as a reference to select actions based on the maximum value. Exploring entails selecting actions at random and discovers new states. When updating, 3 steps take place: the agent starts in a state and takes action to receive an award, the agent selects an action based on the max value or at random, then updates the q-values.
 
These values are adjusted based on the difference between discounted values and old values. The new values are discounted using a discount factor, also known as ùõæ. 

### Hyperparameters
Hyperparameters are constant values that must be set before the learning process begins. These values can be tuned to influence our model‚Äôs learning performance. 

A hyperparameter with too high a value will struggle to decrease the validation error. A hyperparameter with too low a value will take extremely long to learn. The most efficient values are often found through trial and error, with a human inputting test values rather than automatic adjustments. Tuning/optimizing the hyperparameter values properly to the task needed will lead to more accurate learning for a model.

Hyperparameters are optimized to excel at a specific task (ex. training an AI to play Pong) so they will differ among different tasks (ex. training an AI to recognize dogs and cats). 

### Input Layer
The input layer is the first layer of an artificial neural network. Each node in the input layer passes its value to each node of the first hidden layer and is multiplied by weights from the hidden layer nodes. The sum of these weights is passed through the activation function of each individual hidden layer node. 

### Backpropagation
An algorithm that uses the error of an instance to adjust the weights of nodes to decrease error in future instances. (an instance refers to one run of the code)  Propagation in an AI situation represents sending/transmitting information. When an AI makes a prediction, it will have some errors. Backpropagation takes this error and uses it to send back changes to the weights, in an effort to decrease the error. Backpropagation uses Gradient Descent to determine whether to shift the weight values up or down.

### Batch Size
The number of episodes the AI will gather experience for before updating its weights through backpropagation for the next batch.

With a batch size of 10, the AI will run 10 episodes and use the data collected from those 10 episodes to improve its accuracy during the next batch run. This repeats.

### Learning Rate
Learning rate is a hyper-parameter that controls how much weights will change during backpropagation. Gradient Descent will help to determine the best direction of weight value change (up or down), but the learning rate helps determine how much to shift. 

The smaller the Learning Rate, the longer computation time is and vice versa, but too large a learning rate (in the context of the model) can lead to decreased learning accuracy, despite the shorter computation time.

Learning rate is referred to as Œ±.

### Xavier Initialization 
Xavier Initialization assigns random weight values to all neurons in the model. Rather than having completely random weights to begin, Xavier initialization sets weights to be assigned randomly based on a hyperbolic tangent function (ie. the standard normal distribution curve) so that the variance of the weights is 1. This will guarantee that the weights will not begin as too large or too small. If this happens, then the neurons will become saturated, and they will be rendered nearly useless due to their dynamic range and inadequate representational power. All weights chosen through Xavier Initialization lay between 0 and 1.

### ReLU Nonlinearity
ReLU stands for rectified linear unit. ReLU is a common activation function where ReLU is linear for all positive values and zero for all negative values. Mathematically it is defined as y = max(0, x). It‚Äôs sparsely activated meaning since ReLU is zero for all negative inputs, it likely won‚Äôt activate the neuron at all. This means neurons can be dedicated toward the specifics in an image such as identifying the ball vs. paddles. The downside is the ‚Äúdying ReLU‚Äù problem where a ReLU neuron is ‚Äúdead‚Äù if it‚Äôs stuck in the negative side and always outputs 0. Once a neuron becomes zero, it's unlikely to recover, leaving large parts of the network unused. A solution is the ‚Äúleaky ReLU‚Äù which has a small slope for negative values.
